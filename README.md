# terraform-provider-smilecdr

An initial cut at creating a Terraform provider for Smile CDR. Focus early days on security module configurations:
  - Identity Providers,
  - Inbound Security Module
  - Clients
  - Authorization and Permissions.

Then later on, add more comprehensive configurations for Smile CDR.
